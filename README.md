# IEEE-TICPS-LAAs
Data for D-LAAs (IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 39-bus, IEEE 57-bus systems)

These data sets are employed for our paper's numerical results.

The Profiles file structure is specified as: Sample Number * Generator Number * Time steps (100) * Number of dynamic profiles (frequency and phase angles)

The Labels file structure is specified as: Location of the load bus from which the LAA is launched.

Refer to the MATPOWER simulator for additional information regarding the bus numbering procedure.
